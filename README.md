This project is built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, with some custom CSS used for specific cases. It displays the Top 5 Invoices fetched from a simulated API.

I use Axios to fetch data from the Random API, which I created using Next.js to simulate invoice data.

The code is fully responsive for all screen sizes.

I use the Tajawal font for all elements, imported via Google Fonts in the global CSS. Alternatively, it can be imported using next/font/google in the layout to apply it across the entire project.

The design uses a Green/Gold color scheme.

The project is implemented with RTL (Right-to-Left) direction.

Components are loaded using next/dynamic for faster performance.

The table displays the Top 5 Invoices in a clean and responsive format.
